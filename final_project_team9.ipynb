    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a walkthrough of our analysis of the FireCCI51: MODIS Fire_cci Burned Area Pixel Product, Version 5.1 dataset which contains data of burned areas over the continent of Australia from 2001 - 2020. We are conducting this analysis to assess the impact of the 2019 - 2020 Australian bushfire season, known as the Black Summer. The analysis conducted will provide visualizations of vegetation health through the tracking the change of NDVI.\n"

    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This portion of the notebook should contain a summary description of your chosen environmental dataset. In a few paragraphs, discuss:\n",
    "- The creators of the dataset: NASA/NOAA/other government agency? Nonprofit? etc.\n",
    "The European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Programme, Fire ECV are the providers of the dataset MODIS Fire_cci Burned Area Pixel Product, Version 5.1 that we are using in our analysis. Although the satellite MODIS was launched by NASA in 2001, the ESA then made the dataset available via Google Earth Engine. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Major characteristics of the dataset: global coverage? Spatial resolution? Temporal resolution? Creation date? \n",
    "This dataset contains information on burned area on a monthly global ~250m spatial resolution. The dataset uses surface reflectance in the Near Infrared (NIR) band from the MODIS instrument onboard the Terra satellite launched by NASA, as well as active fire information from the same sensor of the Terra and Aqua satellites.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes the estimated day of the first detection of the fire, the confidence level of that detection, and the land cover that has been burned for each pixel. In addition, an observation flag is provided to identify the pixels that were not processed due to the lack of valid observations or because they belong to a non-burnable land cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The file format(s) used to store the data: netCDF? CSV? Other?\n",
    "The data is in GeoTiff format ussing the CRS World Geodetic System (WGS84) and uses the Plate Carrée projection. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The source/archive you will be using to retrieve the data: Google Earth Engine? Agency data portal? Other API?\n",
    "We are accessing this data via Google Earth Engine using the Earth Engine Snippet. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Any known issues with data quality that might be expected to impact the results\n",
    "There are two issues that we noticed regarding data quality. First is that it was noted that there are pixels that could not be processed because of the lack of quality data or because the pixels show land that cannot be burned in the first place (i.e. water). Secondly, the data stops at the end of 2020. This hinders our ability to track land and vegetation recovery rates into 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Include links to any external resources needed to access the data here, including either the location of files stored on an external server you've set up or the access URL for a pre-existing repository. You can also include any example images you find useful for motivating the choice of dataset (optional).\n",

    "### Dataset Input/Output \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, provide code to read in the data necessary for your analysis. This should be in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Import all necessary packages (matplotlib, numpy, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Set any parameters that will be needed during subsequent portions of the notebook. Typical examples of parameters include:\n",
    "- names of any directories where data are stored\n",
    "- ranges of years over which data are valid\n",
    "- any thresholds or latitude/longitude ranges to be used later (e.g. dimensions of NINO3.4 region, threshold SSTA values for El Nino, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Read in the data! If the data files are very large, you may want to consider subsetting the portion of files to be read in (see examples of this during notebooks provided in Weeks 7 and 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a good rule of thumb: It's good to aim for a relatively short amount of time needed to read in the data, since otherwise we'll be sitting around waiting for things to load for a long time. A  minute or two for data I/O is probably the max you'll want to target!"

    " - Assemble all of the data needed in your Github repo: Jupyter notebooks, a README file, and any datasets needed (these should be small, if included within the repo). Larger datasets should be stored on a separate server, and access codes included within the Jupyter notebook as discussed above. \n",

    " - Create an _environment_ file: this is a text file which contains information on the packages needed in order to execute your code. The filename should be \"environment.yml\": an example that you can use for the proper syntax is included in this template repo. To determine which packages to include, you'll probably want to start by displaying the packages loaded in your environment: you can use the command `conda list -n [environment_name]` to get a list.\n",

    " https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#\n",
